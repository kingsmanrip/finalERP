## Project Structure

- `app.py` - Main application file with routes and configuration
- `models.py` - Database models and relationships
- `forms.py` - Form definitions using WTForms
- `templates/` - HTML templates for the web interface
- `instance/` - Contains the SQLite database file
- `static/` - Static files (CSS, JavaScript)
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test suite

## Database Schema

The application uses the following main models:
- **Employee**: Stores employee information and pay rates
- **Project**: Manages project details, status, and relationships to other models
- **Timesheet**: Records work hours with automatic calculation of hours and lunch breaks
- **Material**: Tracks materials used in projects with costs
- **Expense**: Records business expenses with categorization
- **PayrollPayment**: Manages employee payment processing
- **Invoice**: Handles client billing for projects

## Key Model Relationships

All relationships are properly set up with cascade behavior for reliable data management:
- Projects have timesheets, materials, expenses, and invoices
- Employees have timesheets and payroll payments
- Proper validation ensures data integrity across all models

## Security Notes

This version includes basic user authentication. For enhanced security in production:
- Enable HTTPS for secure data transmission
- Implement role-based access control for different user types
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration (including SECRET_KEY)
- Store passwords using strong hashing methods (already implemented)
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Implement proper backup procedures for the database

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
- If you encounter database errors, check that the `instance` directory exists and has proper permissions
- For a fresh start, you can delete the database file in the `instance` directory and reinitialize it

### Port Already in Use
- If port 5000 is already in use, you can specify a different port:
  ```
  python app.py --port=5001
  ```
